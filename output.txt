Paragraph: A murmur arose, in which surprise and disappointment were intermingled.
One fat gentleman, who had been patiently waiting for two hours,
exclaimed: Why, its only a sort of automobile, with crossed airplanes
set over it! I thought they claimed the thing could fly. Those who knew
something of aviation, however, were the ones astonished at Steves
preliminary performance. They realized the advantage of being able to
drive an aroplane on its own wheels, as an automobile goes, in case of
emergencies, and moreover the crossed planesa distinct innovation in
constructiongave them considerable food for thought. Usually the two
surfaces, or floats, of a biplane are exactly parallel, one above the
other; but in Steves machine the upper plane ran fore and aft, while
the lower one extended sidewise. At a glance it was possible to see the
advantage of this arrangement as a duplex balance, which, with the
swinging wing-ends, comprised the safety device that the inventor
believed made his aroplane superior to any other.

of Orissa Kanes feats has little exaggeration except in actual
accomplishment, and it is possible her ventures may be emulated even

Paragraph: Orissa didnt; but Steve did, about a month later. A great aviation meet
had been arranged at Dominguez Field, near Los Angeles and only a few
miles from their own home. The event, which was destined to be an epoch
in the history of aviation, brought many famous aviators to the city
with their machines, among them a Frenchman named Paulhan, with whom
Stephen soon became acquainted. An examination of Paulhans machine, a
Farman of the latest type, which had already performed marvels, served
to convince the boy that his own ideas were not only practical but
destined soon to be discovered and applied by someone else if he himself
failed to take advantage of the time and opportunity to utilize them.
With that argument to calm any misgivings that he might perhaps fail,
coupled with an eagerness to build his invention that drove him to
forsake caution, Steve went to Orissa one day and said:

time the appetite of each spectator was whetted for the great spectacle.
The day seemed ideal for aviation; the sky was flecked with fleecy
clouds and scarcely a breath of air could be felt at the earths
surface.

Paragraph: Now came the first appearance of the Kane Aircraft. It had not been
brought from the hangar during the forenoon and, in watching such
celebrated aroplanes as the Bleriot, Farman, Antoinette, Curtiss and
Wright, manned by the greatest living aronauts, those assembled had
almost forgotten that a local inventor was to enter the lists with them.
The secretary of the Aro Club and others interested had expected Mr.
Burthon to protest against allowing the Kane device to be operated, on
the ground that Kane was entered to operate it and was unable to do so;
but for some unaccountable reason Burthon remained silent, not even
appearing at the field, and Mr. Cumberfords explanation that the Kane
in this instance meant the young mans sister, satisfied the officials
perfectly. Naturally they were surprised and even startled at the idea
of a girl taking part in the great aviation meet, but hailed the
innovation with keenest interest.

iron-and-wood skeleton and the chugging of a tiny engine to ward off
death. Then she came into sight again, a little smudge of grayish white
against the shifting clouds. To see her up there, a mere speck dodging
among the storm clouds, reminded the observers, as nothing in aviation
has ever done before, of the awful audacity of man in building these
mechanical birds. As they watched they found themselves hopingas a

Paragraph: Tyler now observed several aroplanes approaching at full speed, and
realized he must end the chase quickly or be driven from his prey and
prevented from carrying out his diabolical design. He made a quick turn
to head off Orissas circle and the dreadful blades almost touched her
lower plane as she dodged them. Tyler swept round again, but in his
eagerness forgot his balance. Perhaps the man relied too much on the
automatic device that had once brought Stephen to grief; anyway his
aroplane developed a side motion that nearly shook him from his seat.
He tried in vain to restore the balance. The jar caused the motors to
slip; the engines stopped dead; with a rending sound the huge planes
collapsed and the wreck of Burthons biplane began to sink downward.
Tyler was pitched headlong from his seat, but caught a rail and clung to
it desperately as with ever increasing speed the fall to earth
continued.

were filled with pictures of the Burthon device and accounts of the
marvelous flights of Totham Tyler. Nothing more was heard of the Kane
Aircraft, but the public had not forgotten it and many were puzzled that
two local aroplane makers should be exhibiting identically the same
improvements, each claiming to have originated them. As for the visiting
aviators, they were interested, but held their peace. The performances
at the coming competition would tell the story of supremacy, and
whatever good points were displayed by the local inventors could
doubtless be adapted to their own craft. They waited, therefore, for
proof of the glowing claims made in the newspapers. Many promising
inventions have turned out to be failures.

to me, especially fitted to women.
Ah! exclaimed Sybil, with a whimsical glance at the speaker, I have

Paragraph: A murmur arose, in which surprise and disappointment were intermingled.
One fat gentleman, who had been patiently waiting for two hours,
exclaimed: Why, its only a sort of automobile, with crossed airplanes
set over it! I thought they claimed the thing could fly. Those who knew
something of aviation, however, were the ones astonished at Steves
preliminary performance. They realized the advantage of being able to
drive an aroplane on its own wheels, as an automobile goes, in case of
emergencies, and moreover the crossed planesa distinct innovation in
constructiongave them considerable food for thought. Usually the two
surfaces, or floats, of a biplane are exactly parallel, one above the
other; but in Steves machine the upper plane ran fore and aft, while
the lower one extended sidewise. At a glance it was possible to see the
advantage of this arrangement as a duplex balance, which, with the
swinging wing-ends, comprised the safety device that the inventor
believed made his aroplane superior to any other.

Paragraph: Orissa didnt; but Steve did, about a month later. A great aviation meet
had been arranged at Dominguez Field, near Los Angeles and only a few
miles from their own home. The event, which was destined to be an epoch
in the history of aviation, brought many famous aviators to the city
with their machines, among them a Frenchman named Paulhan, with whom
Stephen soon became acquainted. An examination of Paulhans machine, a
Farman of the latest type, which had already performed marvels, served
to convince the boy that his own ideas were not only practical but
destined soon to be discovered and applied by someone else if he himself
failed to take advantage of the time and opportunity to utilize them.
With that argument to calm any misgivings that he might perhaps fail,
coupled with an eagerness to build his invention that drove him to
forsake caution, Steve went to Orissa one day and said:

celebrated aroplanes as the Bleriot, Farman, Antoinette, Curtiss and

almost forgotten that a local inventor was to enter the lists with them.
The secretary of the Aro Club and others interested had expected Mr.
Burthon to protest against allowing the Kane device to be operated, on
the ground that Kane was entered to operate it and was unable to do so;
but for some unaccountable reason Burthon remained silent, not even
appearing at the field, and Mr. Cumberfords explanation that the Kane
in this instance meant the young mans sister, satisfied the officials
perfectly. Naturally they were surprised and even startled at the idea

Paragraph: The air is a mighty thoroughfare, free and untrammeled. The little group
of aroplanes operating over Dominguezdarting here and there, up and
downhad little chance of colliding, for there was space enough and to
spare. Orissa knew all about air currents and their peculiarities and
she also knew that her greatest safety lay in high altitudes. With a
feeling of rapturous exhilaration she began to realize her control of
the craft and her dominance of the air. A masterful desire crept over
her to accomplish great deeds in aviation.

iron-and-wood skeleton and the chugging of a tiny engine to ward off
death. Then she came into sight again, a little smudge of grayish white
against the shifting clouds. To see her up there, a mere speck dodging
among the storm clouds, reminded the observers, as nothing in aviation
has ever done before, of the awful audacity of man in building these
mechanical birds. As they watched they found themselves hopingas a

Paragraph: Tyler now observed several aroplanes approaching at full speed, and
realized he must end the chase quickly or be driven from his prey and
prevented from carrying out his diabolical design. He made a quick turn
to head off Orissas circle and the dreadful blades almost touched her
lower plane as she dodged them. Tyler swept round again, but in his
eagerness forgot his balance. Perhaps the man relied too much on the
automatic device that had once brought Stephen to grief; anyway his
aroplane developed a side motion that nearly shook him from his seat.
He tried in vain to restore the balance. The jar caused the motors to
slip; the engines stopped dead; with a rending sound the huge planes
collapsed and the wreck of Burthons biplane began to sink downward.
Tyler was pitched headlong from his seat, but caught a rail and clung to
it desperately as with ever increasing speed the fall to earth
continued.

Paragraph: This was the 17th of December, and on January first the great
International Aviation Meet was to be held at Los Angeles, with such
famous aviators present as the Wright Brothers, Glenn Curtiss, Hubert
Latham, Arch Hoxsey, their old friend Willard, Parmalee, Ely, Brookins,
Radley and many others. Mr. Cumberford had entered Stephen Kane for this
important meet and the young man was booked to take part in the
endurance and speed tests and to make an attempt to break the worlds
record for altitudeall in his own flyer, the Kane Aircraft. So swift a
transition from obscurity to popularityor at least to the attention of
the civilized worldwas enough to turn the head of anyone; but as yet
Steve seemed all unaware of his own importance.

excel the performances of the old aviators; that isnt my point. The
improvements and novelties we have to show will take the wind out of the
sails of all other aroplanes and result in a flood of orders. Comparing
machine for machine, were years in advance of the Wrights and
Curtissand centuries ahead of those foreign devices.
Perhaps, admitted Tot. But Kanes aroplane is practically the same
as your own, and it is still on the programme.
It wont fly, though, declared Burthon, with a laugh. Dont worry
about anything but your own work, Tyler. Leave all the rest to me.

Paragraph: By this time Burthon had begun a campaign of widespread publicity, and
in spite of the long list of famous aviators in the city the newspapers
were filled with pictures of the Burthon device and accounts of the
marvelous flights of Totham Tyler. Nothing more was heard of the Kane
Aircraft, but the public had not forgotten it and many were puzzled that
two local aroplane makers should be exhibiting identically the same
improvements, each claiming to have originated them. As for the visiting
aviators, they were interested, but held their peace. The performances
at the coming competition would tell the story of supremacy, and
whatever good points were displayed by the local inventors could
doubtless be adapted to their own craft. They waited, therefore, for
proof of the glowing claims made in the newspapers. Many promising
inventions have turned out to be failures.

Paragraph: The most successful aviators of the future, remarked Stephen,
thoughtfully, are bound to be women. As a rule they are lighter than
men, more supple and active, quick of perception and less liable to lose
their heads in emergencies. The operation of an aroplane is, it seems
to me, especially fitted to women.
Ah! exclaimed Sybil, with a whimsical glance at the speaker, I have
discovered my future vocation. I shall aviate parties of atmospheric
tourists. When the passenger airships are introduced Ill become the
original sky motoress, and so win fame and fortune.
Steve laughed, but shook his head.

Paragraph: Suddenly, while the field was clear and half a dozen aroplanes hovered
in the air above it, the Kane Aircraft rolled into the open space,
circled before the grand stand and then, gracefully and without effort,
mounted into the air.
Those who had witnessed Stephens prior performance were not astonished
at this unassisted rise from earth to air, but all were delighted by the
grace and beauty of the ascent and a roar of applause burst
spontaneously from the crowd. The peculiar construction of the aircraft
so diverted attention from its aviator that few marked the slender form
of Orissa, or knew that a girl was making this daring flight.

Are any other aroplanes flying? Mrs. Kane inquired.
Oh, yes, said Sybil. There are several in the air, doing really
marvelous things; but all seem to keep away from Orissa and are more to
the south of us. Theres one, though! she added suddenly. Isnt that

requirements of the atmosphere as well as a gardener knows his earth.
The machine is adjusted to all those variations and demands, and that is
why it accomplishes with ease much that other aroplanes find difficult.
